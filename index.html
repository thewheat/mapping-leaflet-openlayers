<h1>Leaflet vs Openlayers</h1>
<ul>
<li>View source to play around and see how to start playing with each library</li>
<li>Leatlet much easier to get started and play around with and looks nicer</li>
<li>Openlayers much more complex and presume more powerful with better customisation options. Looks mostly based on your own stylings</li>
</ul>
